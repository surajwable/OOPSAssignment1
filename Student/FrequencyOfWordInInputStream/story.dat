India, also known as Bharat, is a Union of States. 
It is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a parliamentary 
system of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution 
of India which was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November,
 1949 and came into force on 26th January, 1950.

The Constitution provides for a Parliamentary form of government which is 
federal in structure with certain unitary features. The constitutional head 
of the Executive of the Union is the President. As per Article 79 of the
 Constitution of India, the council of the Parliament of the Union consists 
 of the President and two Houses known as the Council of States (Rajya Sabha) 
 and the House of the People (Lok Sabha).

Article 74(1) of the Constitution provides that there shall be a Council 
of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head to aid and advise the 
President, who shall exercise his/her functions in accordance to the advice. 
The real executive power is thus vested in the Council of Ministers 
with the Prime Minister as its head.
